=== Lab Topologies

As showing in figure, there are 4 hosts, `lb-1`, `lb-2`, `app-1`, `app-2`, as per host name suggestions, 2 hosts for proxy/loadbalancer, 2 hosts for apps. The hosts for proxy/loadbalancer has 2 NICs, ens33 for public access, and ens34 for NAT or internal route usage. `lb-1` and `lb-2` are in 10.1.10.0/24 network, all hosts are in 10.1.20.0/24 network.

=== Linux Kernel Networking Stack 

There are seven logical networking layers according to the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. The lowest layer is the physical layer, which is the hardware, and the highest layer is the application layer, where userspace software processes are running. These seven layers are:

1. `The physical layer:` Handles electrical signals and the low level details.
2. `The data link layer:` Handles data transfer between endpoints. The most common data link layer is Ethernet. The Linux Ethernet *network device drivers* reside in this layer.
3. `The network layer:` Handles packet forwarding and host addressing. The most common network layers of the Linux Kernel Networking subsystem: *IPv4* or *IPv6*.
4. `The transport layer:` Handles data sending between nodes. The *TCP* and *UDP* protocols are the best-known protocols.
5. `The session layer:` Handles sessions between endpoints.
6. `The presentation layer:` Handles delivery and formatting.
7. `The application layer:` Provides network services to end-user applications.

Linux Kernel Networking stack handles 3 layers, the L2, L3 and L4, correspond to the data link layer, the network layer, and the transport layer in the seven-layer model. The essence of the Linux kernel stack is passing incoming packets from L2 (the network device drivers) to L3 (the network layer, usually IPv4 or IPv6) and then to L4 (the transport layer, where you have, for example, TCP or UDP listening sockets) if they are for local delivery, or back to L2 for transmission when the packets should be forwarded. Outgoing packets that were locally generated are passed from L4 to L3 and then to L2 for actual transmission by the network device driver. 

The kernel does not handle any layer above L4; those layers (the session, presentation, and application layers) are handled solely by userspace applications. The physical layer (L1) is also not handled by the Linux kernel.
