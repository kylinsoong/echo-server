== About netfilter kernel module

The Linux kernel has the built-in ability to filter packets, allowing some of them to be received by or pass through the system while stopping others. The kernel's netfilter has three built-in tables or rules lists. They are as follows:

.*netfilter built-in tables*
|===
|Table |Description

|filter
|The default table for handling network packets.

|nat
|Used to alter packets that create a new connection and used for Network Address Translation (NAT).

|mangle 
|Used for specific types of packet alteration.
|===

Each table has a group of built-in chains which correspond to the actions performed on the packet by the netfilter.

.*netfilter built-chains*

* INPUT — Applies to network packets that are targeted for the host.
* OUTPUT — Applies to locally-generated network packets.
* FORWARD — Applies to network packets routed through the host.

|nat

* PREROUTING — Alters network packets when they arrive.
* INPUT - 
* OUTPUT — Alters locally-generated network packets before they are sent out.
* POSTROUTING — Alters network packets before they are sent out.

|mangle
|

* INPUT — Alters network packets targeted for the host.
* OUTPUT — Alters locally-generated network packets before they are sent out.
