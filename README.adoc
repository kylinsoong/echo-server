TTCP(Test TCP) is an utility to measure TCP throughput through an IP path, test tcp connection, transfers fabricated buffers or data copied from stdin.

TTCP has long history, original created in 18 Dec 84 under 4.2BSD, since then the TTCP improved or modified by several professor/students/engineers/architects, what in this branch there has 3 key improvements:

* Add more options and a conf file /etc/ttcp.conf to adjust Linux Kernel TCP/IP profile in a fine-grained way
* recv side multiple processes ability, which the server side support multi-threads, no exit once a transaction finished
* cloud-native support, both recv and trans can run on K8S and Docker

To use TTCP, start the receiver on one side of the path, then start the transmitter on the other side. The transmitting side sends a specified number of TCP packets to the receiving side. At the end of the test, the two sides display the number of bytes transmitted and the time elapsed for the packets to pass from one end to the other.

[source, bash]
.*Install TTCP*
----
rpm -ivh ttcp-1.14-2.x86_64.rpm
----

[source, bash]
.*Install TTCP(Docker)*
----
docker pull cloudadc/ttcp:1.14-2
----

Either edit the options in `/etc/ttcp.conf` prior to TTCP starting, or pass options as arguments while TTCP starting

[source, bash]
.*Run TTCP*
----
ttcp -t [-options] host [ < in ]
ttcp -r [-options] [multicast-group][ > out]
----

[source, bash]
.*Run TTCP(Docker)*
----
// recv side
docker run -it --rm --name ttcp-r  cloudadc/ttcp:1.14-2

// trans side
docker run --rm --link ttcp-r cloudadc/ttcp:1.14-2-cli ttcp -t ttcp-r

== TTCP for K8S performance benchmark

=== Native Networking Performance

link:docs/k8s-native-net-performance.csv[origin test statistics.]

* Pods on same hosts have more than *1.6 times* TPS of pods across hosts in East-West traffic transmit.
* Pods on same hosts can approach *half of NIC* throughput in East-West traffic transmit.
* Pods on same hosts are *faster than* host to host East-West traffic transmit.
* *Hostnetwork* are the *fastest* way for North-South traffic transmit.
* *Hostnetwork* has the same performance as host to host, can approach *half of NIC* in North-South traffic transmit.
* *NodePort node local* mode have around *1.6 times* TPS of *NodePort node on cluster* mode North-South traffic transmit.
* *HostPort* has same performance as *NodePort node local* in North-South traffic transmit. 
* *NodePort node on cluster* North-South has worst performance, than *ClusterIP pod across hosts* East-West.
